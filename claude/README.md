This directory contains Claude interaction history that was responsible for
generating the VST3Host package. You can copy or hard link these files into 
`~/.claude/projects/-whatever-project-directory-for-VST3Host/` to continue
with the sessions.

I consider this a part of the "open sourceness" of this project - a kind
of full disclosure of its creation process. It is nice that Claude makes
that easy.
